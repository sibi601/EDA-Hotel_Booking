        "The purpose of this EDA is to analyze a hotel booking dataset and understand the key trends, patterns and insights related to hotel bookings. The objective is to use this analysis to identify potential opportunities for the hotel to improve its booking performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Description:\n",
        "\n",
        "The hotel booking dataset used for this analysis contains columns like hotel,is_canceled,lead_time,arrival_date_year,arrival_date_month,arrival_date_week_number,arrival_date_day_of_month,stays_in_weekend_nights etc.\n",
        "Initially,The dataset contains over  119390 rows and 32 columns.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Cleaning and Preparation:\n",
        "\n",
        "The first step in the analysis was to clean and prepare the data for analysis. This involved removing missing values, converting data into appropriate formats and dealing with any outliers.\n",
        "It was found that 31994 duplicate rows.So ,I removed the duplicates and finally we had 87396 rows and 32 columns.I removed the null values with relevant values: Four columns were there with null values namely 'company' , 'agent' , 'country' and 'children'then changed the data type of columns 'children' and 'agent'.ThenI added mainly three columns which can be further used in the project for data visualization and for providing more detailed information.They are 'total_night_spent', 'total_guest' and 'earnings'. In order to find the 'total_night_spent' ,I took sum of the columns 'stays_in_week_nights' and 'stays_in_weekend_nights'. I find the 'earnings' by multiplying 'total_night_spent' and 'adr'. Lastly Inorder to find the 'total_guest', I added 'adults', 'children' and 'babies'.\n",

        "After the above steps Univariate Analysis, Bivariate Analysis, Multivariate Analysis followed by suggestions to client and finally made a conclusion with the prepared analysis."
